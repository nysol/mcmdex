#:count the number of similar records for each record\n\
i(inclusion): find pairs [ratio] of items (weighted sum) of one is included in the other (1st is included in 2nd)\n\
I(both-inclusion): find pairs s.t. the size (weight sum) of intersection is [ratio] of both\n\
S:set similarity measure to |A\\cap B| / max{|A|,|B|}\n\
s:set similarity measure to |A\\cap B| / min{|A|,|B|}\n\
T(intersection): find pairs having common [threshld] items\n\
R(resemblance): find pairs s.t. |A\\capB|/|A\\cupB| >= [threshld]\n\
P(PMI): set similarity measure to log (|A\\capB|*|all| / (|A|*|B|)) where |all| is the number of all items\n\
F:set similarity measure to F-value (2*precision*recall)/(precision+recall)\n\
C(cosign distance): find pairs s.t. inner product of their normalized vectors >= [threshld]\n\

N:normalize the ID of latter sets, in -c mode\n\
n:do not consider a and b in the set when comparing a and b\n\
Y(y):output elements of each set that contribute to no similarity (y:fast with much memory use)\n\
